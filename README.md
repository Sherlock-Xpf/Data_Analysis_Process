## Introduction

This repository is part of a data analysis project centered around location-based datasets. The project demonstrates various stages of the data analysis process, from initial data loading to the final model and visualization. The primary objective is to offer a template for dealing with geographic data and performing insights extraction through code and analysis.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset utilized in this project is related to geographic locations. The data includes several features such as:

- **Location coordinates** (latitude and longitude)
- **Demographic information** (if available)
- **Time-based features** (timestamps, dates)

Detailed dataset information is available in the `data/` directory. The dataset is either sourced from open data or simulated for the purpose of this analysis.
